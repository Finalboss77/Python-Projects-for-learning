# Python-Projects-for-learning
These projects are created for learning purpose ,its open source but copying and pasting projects is not learning. So,learn and create your own.

Right now there are two project that i created for learning purpose for students (Beginners),do view code and dwnload the project file after that if you are using android phone then go to google play store and dwnload Pydroid app.Please donot copy its only to get an idea ,i am repeating donot copy because if u do copy projects ,you will never learn anything.
